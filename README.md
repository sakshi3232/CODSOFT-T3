Repository for Internship tasks at CodSoft


Description : 

This repository showcase the Python-based projects that I developed during my internship at CodSoft, ehich addressing distinct areas of Artificial Intelligence.


Task 3: Image Captioning

Combines computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI.

Features : 
- Uses pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images.
          
- Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.
